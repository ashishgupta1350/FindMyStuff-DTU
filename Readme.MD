Work to do:


4) Make the button toggle one or the other. 

Add java script to load tables(as in semantic UI), forms and images.

5) Make a form for found an item! Image is necessary ?? Not really

6) Create and link routes to the page.

7)  have mongo db as the database, configure database, link tables to the data base

8) install body-parser, link forms to actual list items(lost -> lost list and found -> found list), add security to forms to disable scripting. All routes must be RESTful. (Major work)

9) Install other dependencies including ejs (npm install ejs) express-sanitizer (for script avoidance) 


## Above work is done, comments and user models with session has been added. Google auth is left

Image Uploading is left here. How do I upload image. Referencing through URL is not a good solution.
